You need to compile the DLL before you can do any testing. The DLL is NOT included in this zip file. You will also need to have the SQL DMO files on your computer in order to compile this project (SQLDMO.DLL).
So, in order to make the test project work, you will need to open the Maintenance DLL project first (DBMaintenance.vbp) and compile it to the DLL. Then you can open the test group project (TestGroup.vbg) to test and make any changes you want.
